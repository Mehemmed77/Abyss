## Day 1: What I did today and my next actions.

I initialized zustand and Next.js. Read the docs of zustand, and tried to get used to the syntax.
Thought more about the scope of project rather than actual coding. I have a tendency to leave the project once I see it is "uncool". But I believe this can be the coolest shit I ever do (at least since I started coding).

Thinking about making this an encyclopedia/animations for those who are visual are eager to learn about Operating Systems.
This will be different than just reading the book or reading it from the ChatGPT or from the any AI tool. Because I will
provide customizable animations for each of the chapters. Which is going to be my niche.

Best thing is that, I am not trying to earn money through this. I'm starting this project, because I want to prove myself that I can hold my promise (at least once) when it comes to delivering a good project. 

Hence, this project kills 3 birds with one stone. I learn frontend, C/C++ (for fun), and automatically memorize OSTEP book.

For tomorrow:
- Code simple JSX
- Have demo Websocket server
- Modularize my folder structure from the start
